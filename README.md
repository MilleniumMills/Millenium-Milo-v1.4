# Millenium-Minimill
Here are the CAD files for the Millenium Minimill (WIP) based on the openbuilds minimill. Please note these are not STLs and the design is not final and or may be missing some components such as bearings and screws as well as some parts being unfinished.  We recommend that if you're using an FDM printer that you use PLA or ABS as PETG or NYLON are just not stiff enough despite their strength.  If using an SLA machine (recommended) please use a suitable resin. Siraya tech blu and Esun hard tough are good starts.  If you would like to follow along with the development of this product please follow us on Reddit @ r/MilleniumMachines where you can find links to our website, Patreon page and other social media outlets.
